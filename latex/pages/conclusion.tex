This section focuses on the evaluation of the performance of the CIT and the SIT.

\subsection{Evaluation of the models}
    
    As a general conclusion it can be said that the data hints that it is possible to generate quickly new assets trow this approach. Due to the fact that the models are relatively small and the training dataset is not that big the output of the models is 

    \subsubsection{performance}
    One the big question is if it is possible to generated assets for video game. Here we can split it into two parts. The first part is to generate assets beforehand in the development cylce and in the second part is is the model so efficient that it is possible to generate assets in real time on a local machine.
